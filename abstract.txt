We propose to perform simulations of star formation and the resulting feedback in two different contexts.  First, we will focus on the scale of an individual star cluster forming in a molecular cloud.  We have linked together the ph4 N-body code with the Flash AMR grid code through the AMUSE framework, providing a momentum and energy conserving gravity bridge between the two codes that links them as they evolve in time.  We will use this to follow the feedback from a star cluster as it acts on its surroundings, and the tidal forces from the surroundings as they act on the newly formed cluster.  This will allow us to understand the initial conditions for stellar clusters and the effectiveness of winds, radiation, and supernovae in dispersing gas.  Second, we will use the Enzo cosmological AMR code to focus on an entire dwarf galaxy, following the formation and evolution of all stars above a solar mass, modeling their feedback in some detail, and tracing all major chemical species.  This will allow us to predict the distribution of elemental abundances across the entire stellar population of the galaxy, allowing direct comparison to modern and near-future, large-scale, spectroscopic surveys of dwarf galaxy stellar populations, as well as the abundances of stars in our own halo presumably originating from such galaxies.
