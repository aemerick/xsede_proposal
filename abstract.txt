We propose to perform simulations of star formation and the resulting feedback to understand both the dynamical and the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies. We will use the Enzo cosmological adaptive mesh refinement code to focus on an entire dwarf galaxy, following the formation and evolution of all stars above a solar mass, modeling their feedback in some detail, and tracing all major heavy elements as they are ejected from stars dependent on their mass and evolutionary stage and are then incorporated into new generations of stars.  These simulations will reach 1.5 pc resolution, sufficient to resolve energetic feedback processes in low-density dwarf galaxies.  These models will allow us to predict the distribution of elemental abundances across the entire stellar population of the galaxy, enabling direct comparison to modern and near-future, large-scale, spectroscopic surveys of dwarf galaxy stellar populations, as well as the abundances of stars in our own halo presumably originating from such galaxies.
